<p>Understanding Isaiah 64:6 – Does the Bible Call Righteousness Filthy Rags?</p>
<p>One of the most misused verses in the Bible is Isaiah 64:6, often quoted in a fragmented manner as, “our righteousness is as filthy rags.” This verse is frequently used within Christianity as proof that works or keeping the "old law" (the Torah) are worthless in the eyes of Yah—the very Elohim who gave those instructions for His people to follow.</p>
<p>“And יהוה commanded us to do all these laws, to fear יהוה our Elohim, for our good always, to keep us alive, as it is today. And it is righteousness for us when we guard to do all this command before יהוה our Elohim, as He has commanded us.” (Deuteronomy 6:24-25)</p>
<p>It is illogical to believe that the Creator would give His creation a set of instructions, only to be displeased when they obey Him. To take this idea further into absurdity, this same Creator would then be furious when His creation disobeyed His instructions. Such a contradiction would render it impossible to live in alignment with Yah. However, Scripture itself refutes this fallacy.</p>
<p>“But if a man is righteous and shall do right-ruling and righteousness, if he has not eaten on the mountains, nor lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Yisra’ĕl (Israel), nor defiled his neighbor’s wife, nor comes near a woman during her uncleanness, if he does not oppress anyone, does return to the debtor his pledge, does not commit robbery, does give his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment, if he does not lend on interest or take increase, turns back his hand from unrighteousness, executes right-ruling in truth between man and man, if he walks in My laws, and he has guarded My right-rulings in truth – he is righteous, he shall certainly live!” declares the Master יהוה.” (Ezekiel 18:5-9)</p>
<p>El Shaddai has spoken: the man who walks in His Torah will be counted as righteous. Many astute students of Scripture will recognize that the list provided in Ezekiel consists of commandments from the Torah.</p>
<p>The Messianic Writings and Righteousness</p>
<p>This concept of obeying the Father as the path to righteousness is not lost with the Messiah either.</p>
<p>“Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Master, Master,’ shall enter into the reign of the heavens, but he who is doing the desire of My Father in the heavens. “Many shall say to Me in that day, ‘Master, Master, have we not prophesied in Your Name, and cast out demons in Your Name, and done many mighty works in Your Name?’ “And then I shall declare to them, ‘I never knew you, depart from Me, you who work lawlessness!’” (Matthew 7:21-23)</p>
<p>“For all these the nations seek for. And your heavenly Father knows that you need all these. But seek first the reign of Elohim, and His righteousness, and all these shall be added to you.” (Matthew 6:32-33)</p>
<p>“Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, because they shall be filled.” (Matthew 5:6)</p>
<p>“Blessed are those persecuted for righteousness’ sake, because theirs is the reign of the heavens.” (Matthew 5:10)</p>
<h2>The disciples also affirm this truth:</h2>
<p>“Little children, let no one lead you astray. The one doing righteousness is righteous, even as He is righteous.” (1 John 3:7)</p>
<p>“Because the eyes of יהוה are on the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayers, but the face of יהוה is against those who do evil.” (1 Peter 3:12)</p>
<p>Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves servants for obedience, you are servants of the one whom you obey, whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness? (Romans 6:16)</p>
<p>“And flee from the lusts of youth, but pursue righteousness, belief, love, peace with those calling on the Master out of a clean heart.” (2 Timothy 2:22)</p>
<p>“Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, so that you are healed. The earnest prayer of a righteous one accomplishes much.” (James 5:16)</p>
<p>Examining Isaiah 64:6 in Context</p>
<p>Now that we have established a consistent biblical definition of righteousness—obedience to Yah’s commandments in loving devotion—we turn to Isaiah 64:6 to examine its full context.</p>
<p>“You shall meet him who rejoices and does righteousness, who remembers You in Your ways. See, You were wroth when we sinned in them a long time. And should we be saved? And all of us have become as one unclean, and all our righteousnesses are as soiled rags. And all of us fade like a leaf, and our crookednesses, like the wind, have taken us away. And there is no one who calls on Your Name, who stirs himself up to be strengthened in You; for You have hidden Your face from us, and have consumed us because of our crookednesses. And now, O יהוה, You are our Father. We are the clay, and You our potter. And we are all the work of Your hand. Do not be wroth, O יהוה, nor remember crookedness forever. See, please look, all of us are Your people!”  (Isaiah 64:5-9)</p>
<h2>I included the surrounding verses to provide context. When Isaiah 64:6 is quoted in isolation, it leads to a misunderstanding of the verse’s true meaning. By examining the full passage, we see a more accurate interpretation. Notice Isaiah 64:4:</h2>
<p>“You shall meet him who rejoices and does righteousness, who remembers You in Your ways. See, You were wroth when we sinned in them a long time. And should we be saved?” (Isaiah 64:5)</p>
<p>Isaiah affirms that Yah meets with those who practice righteousness—He does not turn away from them or dismiss their righteous deeds as filthy rags. Those who rejoice in righteousness do so with a sincere and loving heart. The overarching theme of Isaiah is the prophet’s urgent plea to the House of Judah to remember the Elohim of Israel and remain faithful to His ways. Yet, Judah had fallen into backsliding, idol worship, and a corrupt mixture of true and false worship. Though they may have performed certain righteous deeds, their hearts were far from Yah, rendering their actions meaningless. This theme is reinforced throughout Isaiah and is particularly evident in Isaiah 64:7.</p>
<p>“And there is no one who calls on Your Name, who stirs himself up to be strengthened in You; for You have hidden Your face from us, and have consumed us because of our crookednesses.” (Isaiah 64:7)</p>
<p>Remember, Isaiah declares that those who rejoice in righteousness will be met by Yah, while those who refuse to obey the Father will find that He hides Himself from them. This distinction further demonstrates that the righteousness mentioned in Isaiah 64:4 is not the same as the righteousness referenced before or after that verse. The mixed and corrupt worship that Isaiah condemns is not a minor issue—it is a central theme introduced at the very beginning of the book. There, the prophet vividly likens the House of Israel and the House of Judah to Sodom and Gomorrah, underscoring the severity of their spiritual corruption.</p>
<p>“Unless יהוה of hosts had left to us a small remnant, we would have become like Seḏom (Sodom), we would have been made like Amorah (Gomorrah). Hear the word of יהוה, you rulers of Seḏom; give ear to the Torah of our Elohim, you people of Amorah! “Of what use to Me are your many slaughterings?” declares יהוה. “I have had enough of ascending offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts. I do not delight in the blood of bulls, or of lambs or goats. “When you come to appear before Me, who has required this from your hand, to trample My courtyards? “Stop bringing futile offerings, incense, it is an abomination to Me. New Moons, Sabbaths, the calling of gatherings – I am unable to bear unrighteousness and assembly. “My being hates your New Moons and your appointed times, they are a trouble to Me, I am weary of bearing them. “And when you spread out your hands, I hide My eyes from you; even though you make many prayers, I do not hear. Your hands have become filled with blood. “Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your doings from before My eyes. Stop doing evil! “Learn to do good! Seek right-ruling, reprove the oppressor, defend the fatherless, plead for the widow.” (Isaiah 1:9-17)</p>
<p>The New Moons, Sabbaths, and appointed times mentioned in the Torah belong to Elohim, not Judah. Failing to consider the entirety of Scripture leads to the same misunderstanding that many fall into regarding Isaiah 64:4 and the concept of righteousness. Elohim calls His people to return to Him, to seek right-ruling, and to put away evil because El Shaddai does not accept a mixture of wickedness and righteousness. At that time, Israel had corrupted Elohim’s New Moons and appointed days, molding them into their own version through mixed worship. This is why their sacrifices became an abomination to Him—though they honored Him with their lips, their hearts were far from Him.</p>
<p>Israel’s Destiny</p>
<p>Isaiah longed for Israel to return to Yah and fulfill their calling as a light to the nations.</p>
<p>“For Tsiyon’s (Zion’s) sake I am not silent, and for Yerushalayim’s (Jerusalem’s) sake I do not rest, until her righteousness goes forth as brightness, and her deliverance as a lamp that burns. And the nations shall see your righteousness, and all sovereigns your esteem. And you shall be called by a new name, which the mouth of יהוה designates.” (Isaiah 62:1-2)</p>
<p>Yah desires Israel (Biblical Israel) to be a beacon of righteousness for the nations.</p>
<p>“And it shall be in the latter days that the mountain of the House of יהוה is established on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills. And all nations shall flow to it. And many peoples shall come and say, “Come, and let us go up to the mountain of יהוה, to the House of the Elohim of Ya‛aqoḇ (Jacob), and let Him teach us His ways, and let us walk in His paths, for out of Tsiyon (Zion) comes forth the Torah, and the Word of יהוה from Yerushalayim (Jerusalem).” (Isaiah 2:2-3)</p>
<p>Conclusion: Rightly Defining Righteousness</p>
<p>We must allow the Bible to define its own terms rather than imposing our own interpretations—especially when it comes to a concept as vital as righteousness. For generations, many have been misled into believing that following Yeshua in Torah obedience is nothing more than filthy rags—a notion so absurd that it is akin to a man looking at his reflection in a mirror and immediately forgetting his own appearance. Instead, seek out the matter with an earnest heart, become a servant of righteousness, and may the Ruach HaKodesh lead you into all truth.</p>
